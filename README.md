## UX

### The Strategy Plane

**Why are we so special?**

FoodStuff allows users to store and easily access cooking recipes. Users are encourged to add recipies that are simple to make, with easy to access ingredienst. Users can search meals by preperation time, quickly prepeared good food that allows users to take back their evenings and weekends without having to comprimise on nutrition. Foodstuffs encourage users to prepare quick and healthy meals so they don't turn to takeaways. FoodStuff is target towards young adults who find their busy lives can interfere with the quality of food they eat. The site aims to be visual apealing, user freindy with a focus on easilty prepared nutritious meals.

**Who else is building this?**

There is a vast number of recipe sites online at present. These include:
- [bbcgoodfood.com](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/collection/easy-recipes)
- [allrecipes.com](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipes/)
- [bordbia.ie](https://www.bordbia.ie/recipes/)
- [taste.com](https://www.taste.com.au/recipes/collections)
- [simplyrecipes.com](https://www.simplyrecipes.com)

Each of these site has a slightly different layout and varies in features they offer.

**What are the tech considerations?**

As this application is trageted towards a tech savy audienc, there should be a mobile first approach to design and functionality. This product is for general consumers. As this is a B2C product, it should focus heavily on styling and emotive design. The target user is short on time so navigation should be intuitive and layout should quickly and clearly communicate recipie steps and ingredients.

To determine the objectives and user needs for this release I have created the table below. 
Each opportunity/problem is rated on a scale of 1 - 5 in two dimensions; Importance and Feasibility.

Opportunity/Problem | Importance | Feasibility
------------ | ------------- | -------------
Allow users to easily access cooking recipies | 5 | 5
Include fields such as ingredients, preparation steps, required tools, cuisine, etc | 5 | 5
Create form(s) to allow users to add new recipes to the site, edit them and delete them | 4 | 3
Provide results in a manner that is visually appealing and user friendly | 3 | 3
Include a section to recomend cook books | 5 | 5
Provide statistics about recipes | 5 | 5

**User Stories**

- As a first time user, I want to browse through recipes for inspiration on what to cook.
- As a first time user, I want to search by category.
- As a first time user, I want to search a specific food type.
- As a first time user, I want to quickly read through a list of ingredients.
- As a returning user, I want to quickly find a recipie I have used before.
- As a returning user, I want to login in as a user to the site to add my own recipie.
- As a returning user, I want to update/delete a recipe I have added.
- As a returning user, I want to know that my changes have been saved successfully.

- As a site owner, I want to build a community around simple, nutritious meals.
- As a site owner, I want to be notified when a recipie has been added so I can review the content.


### The Scope Plane

#### Feature Scope

To establish the feature scope for this project I am using the agile methodology, I have made a list of all possible features and given each one a difficulty rating between 1 and 3.
Each release will allow for a maximum of 12 points. The table below will be used to determine which features to prioritise and which to schedule for a later release.

Feature | Rating
------------ | -------------
Logo that links to the home page so users can orientate themselves easily | 1
Clear, consistent hamburger navigation on each page | 2
Messaging that clearly communicates the focus of the site  | 1
Responsive design | 1
Load jacascript after DOM content is loaded | 1

Given limited resources, the features that offer the most value at this stage are:

- Clear, consistent hamburger navigation on each page
- Messaging that clearly communicates the focus of the site
- Responsive design
- Load jacascript after DOM content is loaded

The priority is a working card game, any other features will be added at the end if there is time.

### The Structure Plane

As the site will not have a lot of content to begin with a linear narrative will work best. The site will consit of four pages: Home, Recipes, Reading, Login, Register.

### The Skeleton Plane

The wireframes were created using Balsamiq.

![Wireframes](/assets/readme/wireframes.jpg)

### The Surface Plane

#### 1. Font

[DM Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/DM+Sans?query=dm+sans#standard-styles) is a low-contrast geometric sans serif design, intended for use at smaller text sizes, this will be especially helpfull for recipies which have large bodies of text in the steps section as text will be clear and easy to read. The tone of the font is contempory and clear. A backup of `sans-serif`, is included in case of any particular font not rendering as expected. Lower cases is used on the description to enhance readability.

##### 2. Color Scheme

The colour scheme is simple and paired back to allow the focus to be on content and legibility. The primary colour of green is in refrence to nutritious food choices. Hues of the primary green as well as as complimentary hue of warm beige are used throughout the site to aid with visual naviagtion.

- Primary: rgb(177, 236, 178)
- Secondary: rgb(241, 250, 242)
- Tertiary: rgb(248, 245, 241)

##### 3. Logo

The logo incorporates the font DM Sans which has been used across the site to maintain a consistant styling

4. Open Git Bash
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
6. Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
```

7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
